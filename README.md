# Project Scope of Works:

## Project Overview
**BankTermPredict** is a supervised learning project focused on predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing campaign data collected by a Portuguese banking institution.

This real-world dataset captures a rich set of features including client demographics, financial history, and detailed campaign interactions. With over 45,000 records and multiple categorical and numeric fields, the project offers a practical challenge in handling real customer behavior data, dealing with imbalanced classification, and deploying predictive solutions.

Participants will explore trends in marketing effectiveness, engineer features from time and contact history, and build models that learn which clients are most likely to respond positively to outreach efforts.

Participants can choose between:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner Track** â€“ Build classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) using traditional ML methods and deploy via Streamlit
- ðŸ”´ **Advanced Track** â€“ Build a deep learning classifier using FFNN or TabNet, explore explainability, and deploy via Docker/API-based methods

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Track

### Week 1: Setup & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Check for missing values and handle appropriately (especially 'contact', 'pdays', and 'poutcome')
- Convert incorrect data types
- Remove duplicates and outliers where applicable

**2. Feature Formatting**
- Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding where necessary
- Convert binary and ordinal features to numerical formats

**3. Statistical Analysis**
- Analyze distributions of numeric features (e.g., age, balance, campaign, pdays)
- Identify skewed features and consider transformations
- Analyze class imbalance in the target variable ('y')

**4. Correlation & Interaction**
- Plot correlation heatmaps and pairwise feature interactions
- Analyze feature-to-target relationships with count plots, violin plots, and bar plots

**5. Summary & Insights**
- Summarize key takeaways for use in modeling
- Save cleaned and encoded dataset for model development

### Week 2: Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

**1. Feature Engineering**
- Create new features such as contact duration per campaign, campaign frequency, or time since last contact (from pdays)
- Discretize continuous features like balance into bins or z-scores if helpful
- Drop the 'duration' feature for realistic modeling

**2. Encoding & Scaling**
- Ensure categorical variables are fully encoded
- Scale numerical variables with StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler

**3. Data Splitting & Imbalance Handling**
- Split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling
- Apply SMOTE or class weighting strategies for class imbalance

**4. Finalization**
- Save preprocessed datasets
- Ensure reproducibility and documentation of preprocessing pipeline

### Week 3: Model Development & Experimentation

**1. Model Training**
- Train baseline models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Use validation data to track Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

**2. MLflow Integration**
- Log model runs, parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Track experiments and compare baseline models

**3. Model Evaluation**
- Use confusion matrices to analyze prediction errors
- Evaluate models using ROC-AUC, PR curves, and classification reports

**4. Documentation**
- Record learnings, performance insights, and experiment summaries

### Week 4: Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Selection

**1. Optimization**
- Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune best models
- Tune key hyperparameters (e.g., tree depth, regularization strength, learning rate)

**2. Cross-Validation & Performance Checks**
- Validate improvements with k-fold cross-validation
- Compare tuned models with baseline performances

**3. Final Model Packaging**
- Retrain the best model on the full training set
- Save the pipeline and preprocessing logic
- Prepare the model for deployment

### Week 5: Model Deployment

**1. Streamlit app deployment**
- Build a user-friendly Streamlit app that takes client features as input and predicts subscription likelihood
- Host the app on Streamlit Community Cloud


## ðŸ”´ Advanced Track

### Week 1:

Same as Beginner Track â€” perform full EDA as outlined previously.

### Week 2:

Same as Beginner Track, with the following additions:

- **Embedding Preparation**: Prepare integer encoding for high-cardinality categorical variables (e.g., job, education)    
- **Batch Pipeline Setup**: Format data using PyTorch `Dataloader` or TensorFlow `Dataset` with batching, shuffling
- **Preprocessing Storage**: Store preprocessing steps and encodings to be reused in training and deployment

### Week 3: Neural Network Development & Baseline Training

**1. Neural Network Setup**
- Build a simple feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture with input, hidden, and output layers
- Include Batch Normalization, Dropout layers, and ReLU activations

**2. Model Training**
- Compile model using binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
- Train with training and validation sets; monitor overfitting with early stopping

**3. MLflow Logging**
- Log architecture, loss curves, metrics, and trained weights in MLflow

**4. Evaluation**
- Use Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision/Recall to evaluate model on validation set
- Visualize learning curves and errors

### Week 4: Tuning & Explainability

**1. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Tune architecture depth, width, dropout, learning rate, and batch size
- Use validation metrics to drive improvements

**2. Regularization & Scheduling**
